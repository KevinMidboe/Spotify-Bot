# Spotify-Bot
Trying to make a chat-bot used to queue, play and stop songs on the same spotify user. 

Spotipy is used as a wrapper for the spotiy API. 

## Setup
The config file has template variables that must be changed with your own spotify credentials. Credentials are given when registering your [own application](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications) at spotify. The values you need are the clientID, clientSecret, a redirectURI (can be anything, but preferably a contact page or your webpage) and your playlistID.
