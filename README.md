# Spotify-Bot
Trying to make a chat-bot used to queue, play and stop songs on the same spotify user. 

Spotipy is used as a wrapper for the spotiy API. 

A config.py file is hidden from this project as it contains the app ID, secret etc.. 
To get this working, create a config file with the variables: 
username ='your-username'
clientID = 'your-client-ID'
clientSecret = 'your-client-secret'
redirectUri ='your-redirect-uri'
playlistID ='your-playlist-ID'
